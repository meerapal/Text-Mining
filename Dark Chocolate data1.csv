However, my order today the plastic on the box was open but I didn't think much of it. When I took out one of the truffles, there was a strange chemical smell, like cleaning supplies or something toxic. Again, I figured perhaps the Box had been stored near something that smelled and I didn't worry. But then I ate the candy and it TASTED like the same chemical/toxic smell! Yikes!
The taste is still lingering in my mouth and I am worried try any more of them. I will be trying to contacting Amazon about a return or exchange as soon as I finish posting this warning review.
I am not sure where this was shipped from but I just want people to be aware in case it was indeed stored next to something toxic and anyone else gets a box that is also contaminated.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I+eThOwRL.88.jpg

Never, but NEVER put them in a refrigerator freezer because this will only freeze them, and they'll be impossible to eat.

However, when they were shipped, it took a couple of days for them to arrive, and when they were delivered, the ice pack(1) was melted and very hot.

The bottom layers of the truffles were melted and the top portion was very very soft and mushy. I immediately put them into the refrigerator to try to salvage them. This saved some, but not all. These folks should have spared a couple more ice packs to preserve the integrity of this fine product since they were being shipped to Florida, but they didn't.

I ordered this 60 count box of dark chocolate truffles with a plan to take them into work to share with co-workers and guests. I bought a similar milk chocolate one that was perfect. However, this container almost all of the truffles had some degree of melting issues, about a quarter were obvious with chocolate melted on the wrapper and some had leaked into the container (see picture). Unwrapping a few showed that most had some degree of melting as instead of being a smooth ball, they had wrapper lines melted into the chocolate. They still taste ok, but not great and sadly the truffle center seems to be the most affected. I read reviews where other had melting issues, but since weather here and for most of the country was sub-zero, I thought it unlikely to have this issue. I was clearly wrong. I'm glad I got them at a discount- if I had paid full price I would be pretty upset.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81mcslxuOML.88.jpg

They did that on this order but it was good thing.

A few weeks ago (just as the heat was coming) I had ordered some of the Lindt chocolate ,although I had become concerned that by the time it arrived it might be a puddle of chocolate.

Came home and found a box from Amazon in my lobby. As hinted, it was larger than I had expected, and fantasized that maybe they sent me two instead of one. Brought it upstairs and opened the top and saw a large flat piece of styrofoam. Hmm, I thought Amazon didn't pick things in styrofoam anymore (using air bubble and paper). I took the styrofoam sheet out of the box and got a surprise. It wasn't packing material, it was the lid to a cooler (styrofoam box) that had one of those cooling packs and my chocolate in it. So my chocolate was not in a puddle, but in good shape, and ready to help satisfy my chocoholic needs. :-)","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71aFUpepkpL.88.jpg

The photo has 3 chocolates. From the left the old chocolate turning white, middle misshaped chocolate, right from another purchase and what the chocolate should look like.
We are very disappointed. Received in May 2019 and the expiration date is Oct 2019. But this Lindt Lindor round dark chocolate is misshaped and is starting to turn white, which means it is old. The chocolate taste is not the quality Lindt Lindor is known for. I can not use this chocolate.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71gWggVcX-L.88.jpg

Using good real chocolate. Unfortunately my order of Lindt Lindor Dark Truffles arrived melted, which ruined/ruins the inner 'truffle' chocolate. I was able to salvage about half of my order :(
They did include a very nice ice pack to try and avoid this very thing from happening, thou it appears that the heat won out? Either that or UPS didn't do thier job in keeping it refrigerated units? I should've contacted customer service and see if they'd of replaced em; However I was/am recovering from surgery and haven't had the time. That was in August, I just reordered them hoping that the cold fall days will allow me to receive fresh, unmelted, delicious Lindt Truffles ~ they really are good.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2018"

I prefer 72 to 75% dark Coco though. That might help you make your decision.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2017"

But this box was shipped to someone for a Valentine’s present. By Amazon Prime it arrived there several days earlier than mentioned. So that was an added bonus. In the February temperatures, they were in perfect shape. I wouldn’t try shipping this as a gift during hotter months as I understand they could get soft.

These truffles are individually wrapped. That is good as they last a tad longer than if they weren’t. Good to share with others – “Just take one, please!” My wife’s masseuse keeps these at the customer counter, so that’s a “curative treat.” After eating a Lindor chocolate, my taste buds just turn off anything of lesser quality.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2017"

I am absolutely in love with these chocolates! I can personally say these arrived not only on time but they were very well packaged. It is currently the cold season which is around when I usually order them since I read during the hot season they are shipped with ice packs. So no I've packs needed and I didn't have to worry about them melting so that's a plus for me. They were not crushed and they weren't spoiled either, they actually have 8 more months before they expire which is 8 months from when this review is being posted. They did not have an outer white layer as others have complained about. So it's hard to depict which reviews are real and which reviews are competitors or just plain people who want free candy or a refund. Kinda sad I would happily spend more of my hard earned money on these candies and I did, almost 40$ worth every time I order these.

The solid outside to the chocolate inside. I like putting them in the freezer and then eating them but either way they are amazing. I wasn't sure if I wanted to order them online because I read some reviews and some arrived melted and ruined. I gave it a try anyways and was very happy with my choice. I did have the 2 day shipping so not sure if that made a difference. But they arrived in perfect condition.

Unfortunately, although the box I ordered from Amazon was well packed inside a larger carton with some airbags to secure it, due to the temperatures it had to travel in, they arrived soft and melted, I placed the box of chocolates in the freezer to harden them up and then threw out the ones that were a liquid leaking mess that covered the inside of the box and the other wrapped chocolates. I ended up throwing out about 20 of them as they leaked almost entirely out of their wrappers and then spent time wiping off the ones that were still more or less intact. As a result of the heat, the Truffle filling changed consistency due to the melting and hardening it no longer filled the chocolate ball and was not as soft as it usually is but it did have a similar taste.

I should have just returned them straight away or exchanged them for another box but realized that the same thing would happen if I reordered them and at first I didn't realize just how many were candies were nearly empty. So my advice, buy them when the outside temperatures are in the 70's or cooler and you'll get some tasty chocolates.",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2015"

They are kinda rough and whitish on the outside. They still taste good, but have a weird texture on the outside. They weren't melted when they got to me, but it was delivered on kind of a cool morning. They said they mailed them with cooler packs to warm climates. I consider southern california a warm climate especially since its the end of April already, and there were no cooler packs...

I love this chocolate and the price was great, but please, cooler packs so we can enjoy the chocolate as its meant to be enjoyed.

I keep them on my desk for my co-workers to enjoy when they come and visit - and boy, do they! Nice, robust dark chocolate flavor and that soft center makes for a nice contrast with the hard shell on my palate. The only problem is restraining myself - although the fact that they're individually wrapped helps with that as there's no ""oh, it's going to go bad, so I might as well finish it"" pressure.

They also keep really well (if you need to store them). I've kept them (in a cool, dark place) for up to three months and had no change in the flavor.
